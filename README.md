# Chaos Pong

Author: Katherine Wang

Design: In my game, the player can choose to release 3 extra balls into play by pressing any button, creating a more fast-paced and chaotic game of pong. The AI is also improved so that it can determine the closest ball to the AI paddle and quickly respond to it.

How To Play:

Move your mouse up and down to move your paddle (the left paddle). Press any button to release another ball. You can have up to 3 extra balls in play. The goal is to prevent balls from hitting your wall (left wall) and giving the opponent a point, while also trying to score points on the opponent's wall (right wall) by hitting it with balls.
